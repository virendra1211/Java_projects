1. E-Commerce: Product Details API
Scenario: Build a /product/{id} API that shows all details for a product:

ProductService: basic info (name, price, description)

InventoryService: stock availability

ReviewService: average rating and reviews

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<Product> productFuture = ...
CompletableFuture<Inventory> inventoryFuture = ...
CompletableFuture<Reviews> reviewsFuture = ...

return productFuture
    .thenCombine(inventoryFuture, ProductWithStock::new)
    .thenCombine(reviewsFuture, ProductFullDetails::new)
    .join();
Why this matters: Used in storefronts (Amazon, Flipkart) to optimize user experience by reducing page load latency.

***************************
2. Banking: Account Summary
Scenario: Display full account summary to a logged-in user:

AccountService: balances and account numbers

TransactionService: recent transactions

RewardService: reward points, cashback

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<AccountInfo> account = ...
CompletableFuture<List<Transaction>> transactions = ...
CompletableFuture<RewardInfo> rewards = ...

return CompletableFuture.allOf(account, transactions, rewards)
    .thenApply(v -> new AccountSummary(account.join(), transactions.join(), rewards.join()));
Why this matters: Financial dashboards must be responsive and accurate, aggregating multiple systems in real time.

***************************
 3. Travel Booking: Flight Info Aggregator
Scenario: Search engine for flights:

FlightService: flight schedules

PricingService: real-time prices

LoyaltyService: miles/points earned

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<FlightDetails> flight = ...
CompletableFuture<Price> price = ...
CompletableFuture<Loyalty> loyalty = ...

return flight.thenCombine(price, FlightWithPrice::new)
             .thenCombine(loyalty, FullFlightResult::new)
             .join();
Why this matters: Travel apps (Skyscanner, Expedia) must deliver rich, real-time search results by parallelizing remote API calls.
***************************
4. Healthcare: Patient Dashboard
Scenario: Doctor views a patient summary:

PatientProfileService: demographics

MedicalHistoryService: prior conditions

LabResultsService: latest test results

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<PatientProfile> profile = ...
CompletableFuture<History> history = ...
CompletableFuture<LabResults> labs = ...

return CompletableFuture.allOf(profile, history, labs)
    .thenApply(v -> new PatientSummary(profile.join(), history.join(), labs.join()));
Why this matters: In clinical settings, quick decision-making depends on aggregating diverse, siloed medical data.

5. Ride Sharing App: Trip Details API
Scenario: /trip/{id} gives full trip breakdown:

TripService: driver, route, duration

PaymentService: cost, payment status

RatingService: feedback

Same pattern applies.
***************************
Takeaway Patterns:
thenCombine for merging two related results.

allOf + join() for many parallel tasks.

Ideal for microservice aggregation, API Gateway, GraphQL Resolvers, etc.

Want one of these coded fully in Spring Boot or with WebClient/Reactive stack?


****************** IMPORTANT TIPS *************************
- allOf + join() for many parallel tasK
- thenCompose() is useful to chain two dependent CompletableFuture instances
- thenCombine() is useful to chain two independent instances of CompletableFuture .
